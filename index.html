<section id="about">
  <p>I am currently a Reinforcement Learning Engineer at a cutting-edge startup developing tactile sensors, dexterous hands, and humanoid robots.</p>

  <p>I received my bachelor's degree in Photoeletronic Science and Engineering ( basically Laser stuff :) ) from the Southwest University of Science and Technology, China,
  and my master's degree in Sensor and Cognitive Psychology from the Chemnitz University of Technology,Germany, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/physik/PHKP/wolfgang.html.en" target="_blank" class="academic-link">Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Einhäuser-Treyer</a> from Physics of Cognition group and <a href="https://www.uni-koblenz.de/de/informatik/icv/neubert/" target="_blank" class="academic-link">Prof. Dr. Peer Neubert</a> from Autonome Systeme group of University of Koblenz.</p>


  <p>I am generally interested in the intersection of Machine learning and Human-Robot Interaction. My hope is to build a humanoid robot that can learn from human interactions and improve its performance over time.  I am particularly interested in leveraging bio-inspired algorithms and insights from cognitive science to optimize the performance of AI-robotic systems.</p>

        This thesis investigates human behavior in VGL tasks.  Which could gain a better understanding of the human process of solving VGL tasks, which in turn could inform the design of machine VGL algorithms and inspire novel approaches.

  <!-- 研究兴趣部分 -->
  <h3>Research Interests</h3>
  <p>Within machine learning, Embodied AI, and human-robot interaction, I am particularly interested in:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: developing algorithms that enable robots to learn from interaction and improve performance over time.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Human-Robot Interaction</strong>: creating intuitive interfaces and learning mechanisms for robots to understand and adapt to human preferences.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bio-inspired Learning</strong>: incorporating cognitive science findings and biological principles into machine learning algorithms.</p>


  <p><strong>Representation learning</strong>:  pursuing the fundamental question of how robots can learn to build internal models that bridge the gap between raw sensory experience and meaningful action, creating a unified cognitive architecture.</p>

  Beside that, I have also been working on the following topics: Mashine Learning of Graphs/Graph Theory, Vector Symbolic Architectures, and Neuro-Symbolic AI,Causality Inference and Decision Making, Fuzzy Logic.

  <h2>Me</h2>
  <p>I enjoy reading books, watching movies and dramas, and gaming — mostly sci-fi, scene comedy, philosophy, and historical dramas. I'm drawn to new experiences, so I'm always learning something different (recently kendo, sign language, and French). I love to travel and collect different perspectives to draw my own conclusions.  </p>


  
  <h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
  <div style="display: flex; gap: 25px; align-items: flex-start; margin: 20px 0;">
    <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 0;">
      <p>When I was 7 or 8, I was drawn to reading sci-fi novels and short stories. Later, watching The Big Bang Theory sparked something deeper — Leonard's character influenced my professional path in ways I didn't expect. Combining my passion for sci-fi with the academic template from the show, I entered college studying laser physics, dreaming of becoming an experimental scientist.</p>
      <p>The opportunity to study physics in Germany felt like living Sheldon's dream. But somewhere between the equations and lab work, I discovered something unexpected: I was more fascinated by the human side of physics than the pure science itself. That realization led me to an interdisciplinary major — a decision that would reshape how I think about everything.</p>

  <h3>Between Worlds</h3>

    <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 0;">
      <p>Physics taught me to see the universe as equations dancing in perfect harmony. But equations, I discovered, don't capture the tremor in a voice or the weight of a decision. They don't explain why humans reach for the stars or why we fear the very technologies we create.
      Leaving pure physics felt like stepping out of a cathedral of certainty into a wilderness of questions. In this interdisciplinary space, I learned to think like a weaver — pulling threads from physics, psychology, philosophy, and beyond, watching them intertwine into patterns I never could have imagined alone.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  The most beautiful discoveries, I realized, don't live within the neat boundaries of disciplines. They emerge in the liminal spaces, where different ways of seeing the world collide and spark something entirely new. It's in these intersections that I found my calling — not just to understand how things work, but to understand how they can shape us.</p>

    <h3>A Human-Friendly Future </h3>

  <div style="display: flex; gap: 25px; align-items: flex-start; margin: 20px 0;">
    <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 0;">
      <p>As a sci-fi fan turned researcher, I've moved from consuming visions of the future to actively shaping them. We're not riders of the tech wave — we're the ones who shape its direction. That's both our privilege and our burden.
      Standing at this unique position of defining cutting-edge technology, I believe we have a responsibility to choose our path carefully. While most people can only passively accept the results of technological development, we as definers have both the opportunity and obligation to pursue a more human-centered technological trajectory.</p>

  I want to build AI and robots that embody the future we choose, not the one we fear. Systems that evolve smartly through interaction, measured not by efficiency alone, but by how they elevate the human experience. Because technology should serve what humans truly need: not just survival, but dignity.</p>
  <p>This vision guides every research decision I make and every line of code I write.</p>
